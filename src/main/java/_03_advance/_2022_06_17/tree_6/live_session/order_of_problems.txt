1. iterative post order traversal of a binary tree
2. given a node, get right most node of inorder in LST (already done in tree_5 session)
3. Deletion of a node in binary search tree
4. given a perfect binary tree, link the nodes side ways.
    idea-1 : using level order traversal + queue
    idea-2 : check code.
5. find two swapped nodes of BST




Note:

A full binary tree has all it's nodes with either none or two children.
A complete binary tree of height h could be one in which all nodes up to level h have two children.
A perfect binary tree is a tree which is both full and complete.
