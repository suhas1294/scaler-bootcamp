1. inorder traversal - using recursion (prerequisite)
2. inorder traversal - using iterative approach (in assignments folder)
3. In the inorder traversal of a tree, what is the last node we print ?
    ( ans : we print the right most node in the right sub tree, if there is no right sub tree, print root)
4. Morris inorder traversal ( space complexity O(1))
5. Given 2 values of Binary tree, find shortest path between them - to illustrate LCA (least common ancestor)
6. LCA in BST
