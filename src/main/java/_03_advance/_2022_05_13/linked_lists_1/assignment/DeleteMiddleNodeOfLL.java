/*
Given a singly linked list, delete middle of the linked list.
For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then linked list should be modified to 1->2->4->5
If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, we need to delete
the second middle element. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then it
should be modified to 1->2->3->5->6. Return the head of the linked list after removing
the middle node. If the input linked list has 1 node, then this node should be deleted
and a null node should be returned.
Input Format :  The only argument given is the node pointing to the head node of the linked list
