Question:

A spider is trying to build a web for itself. The web built by it doubles everyday.
If the spider completely built the web in 15 days, how many days did it take for the
spider to build 25% of the web?

Answer is a integer. Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer.
If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity.

Soln:
If the spider has already done 25%, the next day it will have reached 50%.
An the day after it will have completed its work to a full 100%.
If it took 15 days to reach 100% then at day 13 it will have passed the 25% mark.
