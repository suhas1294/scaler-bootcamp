Question:

In a country where everyone wants a boy, each family continues having babies till they have a boy.
After some time, what is the proportion of boys to girls in the country?
(Assuming probability of having a boy or a girl is the same)

Round off your answer to 2 decimal places and output the answer as I.xx
where I is the integer part of your answer, and xx are the first 2 decimal places of the rounded off answer.


solution:
Assume there are C number of couples so there would be C boys. The number of girls can be calculated by the following method.
Number of girls = 0*(Probability of 0 girls) + 1* (Probability of 1 girl) + 2* (Probability of 2 girls) + ... = 0 + C/4 + 2C/8 + 3C/16 + ...

Number of girls = 0*(Probability of 0 girls) + 1*(Probability of 1 girl) + 2*(Probability of 2 girls) + ...
Number of girls = 0*(C*1/2) + 1*(C*1/2*1/2) + 2*(C*1/2*1/2*1/2) + ...
Number of girls = 0 + C/4 + 2*C/8 + 3*C/16 + ...
Number of girls = C

(using mathematical formulas; it becomes apparent if you just sum up the first 4-5 terms)
The proportion of boys to girls is 1 : 1. As such, the answer would be 1.00
