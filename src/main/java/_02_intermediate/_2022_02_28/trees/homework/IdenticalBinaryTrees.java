public class IdenticalBinaryTrees {
}

/*
Given two binary trees, check if they are equal or not.
Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally
identical and the nodes have the same value.

1 <= number of nodes <= 10^5

First argument is a root node of first tree, A.
Second argument is a root node of second tree, B.
Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem.

Input 1:

   1       1
  / \     / \
 2   3   2   3

output: 1
exp: Both trees are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

Input 2:

   1       1
  / \     / \
 2   3   3   3

output: 0
Value of left child of the tree is different.
