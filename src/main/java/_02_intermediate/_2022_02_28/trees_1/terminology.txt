1. Nodes - Nodes are the building blocks of any data structure. They majorly contain some data and link to the next/previous nodes. In the case of binary trees, they contain the address of the left and the right child respectively.

2. Root - The topmost node in a tree is known as the root node. A tree can have at most one root node.

3. Parent Node - A node (except the root) that has a succeeding node is known as a parent node.

4. Child Node - A node that has a preceding node is known as a child node. A node can be both parent and child depending on the node that is in context.

5. Leaf Node - A node with no children.

6. Internal Node - A node that has at least one child node is known as an internal node.

7. Depth of a Binary Tree - The number of edges from a node in the tree to the root node.

8. Height of a Binary Tree - The number of edges from the deepest node in the tree to the root node.
