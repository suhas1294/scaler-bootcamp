/*
You are given a huge number in the form of a string A where each character denotes a digit of the number.
You are also given a number B. You have to find out the value of A % B and return it.

1 <= A.size() <= 10^5
0 <= Ai <= 9
1 <= B <= 10^9

The first argument is the string A.
The second argument is the integer B.
Return a single integer denoting the value of A % B.

Input 1: A = "143" B = 2, output: 1, explanation: 143 is an odd number so 143 % 2 = 1.
Input 2: A = "43535321" B = 47, output : 20 , expanation: 43535321 % 47 = 20
